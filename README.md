Folding Map
===========

## About:
	
Folding Map came about from work done with various nonprofits who needed to do some basic mapping.  At the time the available options for commercial applications cost too much, free options were difficult for people to use or didnâ€™t have the right feature sets.  Since then FoldingMap has been completely rewritten to incorporate new features and better design options. 

Folding Map is written in Java and is supported on Windows, OSX and Linux.
